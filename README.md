# LSXWriter
Quick and dirty program to generate the modsettings.lsx file for BG3 I wrote in a couple hours. Made for linux, but it should work on windows too.

## Usage
`lsxwriter "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1086940/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3" --write`
